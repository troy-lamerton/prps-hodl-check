# intro

Want to make a small page where anyone can check their hodled Purpose.

Discovered:
Every hodl is stored in a private mapping of [creator & id] to hodl object.

You MUST have the __hodl id__ and __address__ of the person who hodled the Purpose,
to get the hodl objects.

It is possible to 'brute force' a persons hodl ids, but it takes some time.

# TODO

make a node script that can brute force unknown hodl ids. simply by iterating from 1 to 1 million, etc.
